#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) Should only loop based on "a"


b)O(nlogn) It loops n times and log n base on j doubling?


c)O(n) Because it should only run "bunnies" times?

## Exercise II

Starting at the first floor drop an egg

check if egg broke or not and keep track

move to next floor and repeat

Should be O(n) as it should only run as long as "eggs"
